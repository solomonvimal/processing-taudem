TauDEM algorithms for SEXTANTE
------------------------------
TauDEM (Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models) is a suite of
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of
hydrologic information from topography as represented by a DEM.

SEXTANTE is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to call native
and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis tasks
more productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements TauDEM provider for SEXTANTE and allows to run
TauDEM algorithms from SEXTANTE.

                      !!! IMPORTANT !!!
TauDEM provider now is a part of the SEXTANTE core distribution. This plugin now
obsolete and exists only for historical reason. Please report any bugs and submit
feature requests to SEXTANTE bugtracker at:
