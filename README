TauDEM algorithms for Processing
--------------------------------
TauDEM (Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models) is a suite of Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic
information from topography as represented by a DEM.

Processing (former SEXTANTE) is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to
call native and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis
tasks more productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements TauDEM provider for QGIS Processing framework and allows
to run TauDEM algorithms from QGIS.

                      !!! IMPORTANT !!!
TauDEM provider now is a part of the Processing core distribution. This plugin
now obsolete and exists only for historical reason. Please report any bugs and
submit feature requests to QGIS bugtracker at
https://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues
under "Processing (SEXTANTE)/TauDEM" category.
