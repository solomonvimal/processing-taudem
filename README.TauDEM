To use this plugin you need to install TauDEM command line tools.

Windows
----------
Please visit TauDEM homepage for installation instructions and precompiled
binaries for 32bit and 64bit systems. NOTE: you need TauDEM 5.0.6 executables,
version 5.2 currently not supported

TauDEM homepage: http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5.0/downloads.html

Linux
----------
There are no packages for most Linux distribution, so you should compile
TauDEM by yourself. As TauDEM uses MPICH2 first install it using your favorite
package manager. Also TauDEM works fine with OpenMPI, so you can use it
instead of MPICH2.

Download TauDEM 5.0.6 source code and extract files in some folder

TauDEM sources: http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5.0/TauDEM5PCsrc_506.zip

Open linearpart.h file and add after line

#include "mpi.h"

new line with

#include <stdint.h>

so you'll get

#include "mpi.h"
#include <stdlib.h>

Save changes and close file. Now open tiffIO.h, find line #include "stdint.h"
and replace quots ("") with <>, so you'll get

#include <stdint.h>

Save changes and close file. Create build directory and cd into it

mkdir build
cd build

Configure your build with command

CXX=mpicxx cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..

and then compile

make

Command

sudo make install

will install TauDEM into /usr/local/bin
